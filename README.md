## üí° Why I Made This Script

Zyxel routers (such as the EX7710-B0 and EX5601-T0) have a frustrating issue:
when using **Bitwarden** (or similar password managers), the router‚Äôs login page often **deletes or corrupts the autofilled password**.

This leads to errors like:

* ‚ÄúThe username or password is not correct or locked.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúLength of password is from 4\~64.‚Äù

This script makes Bitwarden autofill work reliably on Zyxel router login pages.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Keeps passwords stable**: Prevents Zyxel‚Äôs UI from wiping out autofilled passwords.
* **Works with SPA login pages**: Handles redirects (`/ ‚Üí /login`), re-renders, and logout flows.
* **Bitwarden-friendly**: Uses the exact password Bitwarden fills ‚Äî nothing is stored or altered.
* **Compatible models**: Confirmed on EX7710-B0 and EX5601-T0; likely works with other Zyxel routers too.
* **Lightweight & safe**: No external calls, no saved data, no special permissions.

## üì• Installation

1. Install a userscript manager if you don‚Äôt already have one:

   * [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   * [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
   * [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (not as well tested)

2. Install this script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/XXXXX-zyxel-bitwarden-autofill-fix).

3. Open your router‚Äôs login page (e.g. `http://192.168.1.1/`) and let Bitwarden autofill your credentials.

   * Click **Login** (or press Enter) ‚Äî the script ensures the password is submitted correctly.

---

## ‚öô How It Works

* Keeps the unmasked password field visible so Bitwarden‚Äôs autofill stays intact.
* Listens for autofill events and remembers the value only in page memory.
* Just before login (button click or Enter key):

  * Copies the password into all fields Zyxel‚Äôs code might read.
  * Fires `input`, `keyup`, and `change` events so validation runs normally.
* Works even when Zyxel‚Äôs single-page app re-renders the login form.

## ‚úÖ Known Working Models

* Zyxel **EX7710-B0**
* Zyxel **EX5601-T0**

> If you confirm this script works on other Zyxel models, feel free to share so they can be added here.
